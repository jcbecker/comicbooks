            <p>
                There's a blackbird perched outside my window</br>
                I hear him calling</br>
                I hear him sing</br>
                He burns me with his eyes of gold to embers</br>
                He sees all my sins</br>
                He reads my soul</br>
                One day that bird, he spoke to me</br>
                Like Martin Luther</br>
                Like Pericles</br>
                </br>
                Come join the murder</br>
                Come fly with black</br>
                We'll give you freedom</br>
                From the human trap</br>
                Come join the murder</br>
                Soar on my wings</br>
                You'll touch the hand of God</br>
                And He'll make you king</br>
                And He'll make you king</br>
                </br>
                On a blanket made of woven shadows</br>
                Flew up to heaven</br>
                On a raven's glide</br>
                These angels have turned my wings to wax now</br>
                I fell like Judas from grace tonight</br>
                On that day that he lied to me</br>
                Like Martin Luther</br>
                Like Pericles</br>
                </br>
                Come join the murder</br>
                Come fly with black</br>
                We'll give you freedom</br>
                From the human trap</br>
                Come join the murder</br>
                Soar on my wings</br>
                You'll touch the hand of God</br>
                And He'll make you king</br>
                And He'll make you king</br>
                </br>
                I walk among the children of my fathers</br>
                The broken wings, betrayal's cost</br>
                They call to me but never touch my heart, no</br>
                I am too far</br>
                I'm too lost</br>
                </br>
                All I can hear is what he spoke to me</br>
                Like Martin Luther</br>
                Like Pericles</br>
                Come join the murder</br>
                Come fly with black</br>
                We'll give you freedom</br>
                From the human trap</br>
                Come join the murder</br>
                Soar on my wings</br>
                You'll touch the hand of God</br>
                And He'll make you king</br>
                And He'll make you king</br>
                </br>
                So now I curse that raven's fire</br>
                You made me hate, you made me burn</br>
                He laughed aloud as he flew from Eden</br>
                You always knew, you never learn</br>
                The crow no longer sings to me</br>
                Like Martin Luther</br>
                Or Pericles</br>
                </br>
                Come join the murder</br>
                Come fly with black</br>
                We'll give you freedom</br>
                From the human trap</br>
                Come join the murder</br>
                Soar on my wings</br>
                You'll touch the hand of God</br>
                And He'll make you king</br>
                And He'll make you king</br>
                </br>
                Come join the murder</br>
                Come fly with black</br>
                We'll give you freedom</br>
                From the human trap</br>
                Come join the murder</br>
                Soar on my wings</br>
                You'll touch the hand of God</br>
                And He'll make you king</br>
                And He'll make you king</br>
